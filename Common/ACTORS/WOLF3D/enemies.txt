//Enemies, projectiles used in Wolfenstein 3D

// Items With Spawn Numbers follow the following rules:
// 	1) Numbered in order of appearance (1-15)
//	2) Still Actors are 200XX, where XX is 1-15
//	3) Moving Actors are 202XX, where XX is 1-15
//	4) Pac-Man Ghosts are a special case, as I forgot to add 200.
