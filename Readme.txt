How to Run:
1)	Requires at least version 2.7.0 of ZDoom

2)	Put this 'Wolfenstein 3D TC' folder in your ZDoom folder 
	(so that your directory structure looks similar to 'C:\Games\ZDoom\Wolfenstein 3D TC').  

3)	Navigate to the newly-unzipped 'Wolfenstein 3D TC' folder and double-click 'Wolf3D.bat', 
	'SoD.bat', or 'Consolidated TC.bat', depending on which game you want to play.

	The .bat file will automatically create a copy of your current ZDoom .ini file, or a new 
	.ini file if it is unable to find your current one.  You can modify the path in the .bat 
	files if your .ini is not found automatically.  The .cfg settings will be applied to this 
	.ini file, so that the .cfg file will not overwrite your regular game settings.  

Notes:	You can use any IWAD with this, however, games other than Doom or Doom 2 will give some 
	strange effects (inability to walk through doorways, blood spurts, pieces of status bar 
	visible, etc.).  Because of this, I recommend that you use one of the Doom IWADs.

	This TC has enough resources to act as its own IWAD, however, ZDoom will not load .pk3s
	as IWADs at this time.

	If you don't want to use the .cfg file, just drag and drop the .pk3 as you normally would.

Any questions, please ask!
